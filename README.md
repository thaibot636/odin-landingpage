Project: Odin Landing Page
Date: March 2025
Author: FranklynS.

This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course. The goal was to build a basic landing page using HTML and CSS, based on a design provided in the assignment. The design came in the form of two images — one showing the full layout and another showing the font and color details.

The project helped me practice how to structure a web page with different sections, including a hero section, some informational content, a quote section, and a call-to-action area with a sign-up button. I used Flexbox to handle most of the layout, and kept the design as close as I could to the original image, though it doesn’t have to be pixel-perfect.

I also learned how to manage spacing, fonts, colors, and buttons using CSS. The button has a simple hover effect to make it more interactive. The call-to-action section was especially helpful for learning how to center and space content properly.

The content and images on the page can be personalized. I used free-to-use placeholder images, and I’ve made sure that they’re okay to use based on their licenses. Good sites to find free images include Unsplash, Pexels, and Pixabay.

This project also helped me get more comfortable using Git and GitHub. I committed my progress regularly and pushed the code to a repository. Later on, I can even publish the project using GitHub Pages.

I’m proud of how this page turned out, and it’s a nice step forward as I continue learning. Up next, I’ll start working with JavaScript.
